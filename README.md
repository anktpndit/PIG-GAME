# PIG-GAME
Pig Game is a simple game made by manipulating DOM elements. It is a game where two players roll a die, and they both try to reach 100 points as fast as possible. The player reaching 100 points first wins.
Rules of the game are very simple:
1) If you get a 1, then your turn is over.
2) The objective of the game is to hold points until you are the first one to reach 100 points. You can roll as many times as you want until you get a 1. If you didn't press hold until you get a 1, all the gathered points from the beginning of your turn are lost. 
3) If you choose to hold points, then you hold the points you got, but your turn will be over.

Have fun playing!
